# AI-based-music-generation
 Developed a deep learning model using LSTM networks to generate music by learning from MIDI datasets.  Used PrettyMIDI and TensorFlow to extract, process, and synthesize musical notes into playable audio. Designed  a note prediction system to generate realistic sequences based on pitch, step, and duration.
